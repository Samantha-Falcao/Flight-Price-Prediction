# Flight-Price-Prediction
Project aimed at prediction of flight tickets price using the given data for flights over various months and across various cities in India.

# About
This project was completed as a part of an assessment at GreyAtom Edutech Pvt. Ltd.
The dataset and problem was provided by GreyAtom, and the challenge was to explore the data, derive useful insights and build machine learning models to predict the price of flights for the given test data within 4 days of time.

# Problem Statement
Flight ticket prices can be something hard to guess, today we might see a price, check out the price of the same flight tomorrow, it will be a different story. We might have often heard travelers saying that flight ticket prices are so unpredictable. Or, are they? As data scientists, the task is to prove that given the right data anything can be predicted. You have been hired as a Data Scientist for "Mytravelbookings.com". As a data scientist, you will be provided with prices of flight tickets for various airlines between the months of March and June of 2019 and between various cities.

Your objective is to predict the flight prices using that data
